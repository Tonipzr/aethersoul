    m_Localized: Emberis, the goddess of fire, represents both creation and destruction.
      Her heart burns with passion but her fury is capable of reducing worlds to
      ashes. Her followers revere her as the bearer of the spark that ignites life
      but also fear her ability to lay waste to everything in her path.

    m_Localized: Mareira, the goddess of water, is a constant flux between serenity
      and chaos. She holds the memories of time in oceans that murmur the forgotten
      stories of dreamers. Her tears fall as benevolent rains, but her wrath manifests
      itself in tsunamis that devour civilisations. Mareira teaches her chosen ones
      that strength lies in adaptability and persistence.

    m_Localized: Sylvara, the goddess of the earth, is the protector of stability
      and the keeper of ancient secrets. In her roots lives the wisdom of forgotten
      ages and in her mountains is forged the strength of dreamers. Sylvara is firm,
      motherly and stern, guiding those who listen to her with lessons of resilience
      and endurance. However, her patience is not infinite, those who defy her will
      face earthquakes and punishments of unrelenting force.

    m_Localized: Brisalia, the goddess of air, is the freest and most capricious.
      Light as a breeze or devastating as a cyclone, she never stays in one place
      or one state for long. Her followers learn that change is inevitable and that
      true freedom is found in letting go, even when fate seems confusing.
